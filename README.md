# GuitarNoteGame
A game designed to help memorise the positions of notes on a guitar 

Current version is for a classical 6-string guitar with standard tuning up to the 19th fret.

# Options
Additional options to change the difficulty settings for frets and strings:
Tuning:
  - Can alter the tuning of the open strings
  - In theory, you can add or remove strings in this tuning and it will still work, however it will mess up the string difficulty setting below (for easy & medium) 
Frets:
  - Easy (1) - Up to 5th fret
  - Medium (2) - Up to 12th fret
  - Hard (3) - Up to 19th fret
Strings:
  - Easy (1) - 1st and 6th strings only
  - Medium (2) - 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th strings only
  - Hard (3) - all six strings
